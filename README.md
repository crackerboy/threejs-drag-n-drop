# threejs-drag-n-drop

A scene rendered in three.js, with OrbitControls (to move around the scene) and DragControls (to move objects around).

Usage: open `index.html` in browser.

### Issues

.obj model is loaded into a Group. Currently, only one individual Object can be moved at a time (cannot move the whole Group together)
